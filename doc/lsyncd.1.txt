lsyncd(1)
=========
:doctype: manpage

NAME
----
lsyncd â€” a daemon to continously syncronize dircectory trees 

SYNOPSIS
--------
config file: ::
    {zwsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] 'CONFIG-FILE' 

default rsync behaviour: ::
    {zwsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] -rsync 'SOURCE' 'TARGET' ...

default rync+ssh bevahior (moves and deletes through ssh): ::
    {zwsp}*lsyncd* ['OPTIONS'] -rsyncssh 'SOURCE' 'HOST' 'TARGETDIR' ...

DESCRTIPTION
------------
Lsyncd(1) watches a local directory trees event monitor interface (inotify).
It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and then spawns one (or
more) process(es) to synchronize the changes. By default this is rsync(1).
Lsyncd is thus a light-weight live mirror solution that is comparatively easy
to install not requiring new filesystems or blockdevices and does not hamper
local filesystem performance.

Rsync+ssh is an advanced action configuration that uses a SSH(1) to act file
and directory moves directly on the target instead of retransmating the move
destination over the wire.

More fine-grained customizaton can be achieved through the CONFIG-FILE.  Custom
action configurations can even be written from scratch in cascading layers
ranging from shell scripts to code written in the LUA(1) language.  This way
simplicity can be balanced with powerfullness.  See the online manual for
details on the CONFIG-FILE http://code.google.com/p/lsyncd/wiki/Lsyncd2.0Manual

OPTIONS
-------
*-delay* 'SECS'::
	Overrides the default delay times.

*-help*::
	Show a help message.

*-log* 'LEVEL|CATEGORY'::
	Controls which kind of events are logged. By default Lsyncd logs 'Normal'
	and 'Error' Messages. *-log scarce* will make Lsyncd log Error messages
	only. Debug messages are grouped in categories. *-log all* will log all
	debug messages. -log Inotify will e.g. only log additional information
	about the inotify monitor.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Terminated on a TERM signal(7)

*-1*::
	Failure (syntax, unrecoverable error condition, internal failure)
